A simple and faster Tapatalk Client for C#, Windows Phone.

 * This application designed for tapatalk APIs (and tested only on xenforo)

How To Use
========

Open General class file and find this line.
* public static string forum_domain = "";

You must provide your forum url for connection. Change this variable with yours. (e.g. "http://www.huseyinelmas.net/forum/")

For smileys settings open Smiley class file and re-edit "sSmileyAddress" variable with the correct one.

That is a first application in the world. There is no any such application sample like this as open source in C#, mobile.
